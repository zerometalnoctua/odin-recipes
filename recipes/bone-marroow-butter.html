    <h4>Finished Product! Yum!</h4>
    <p>
      Bone Marrow Butter is a little exotic, a little decadent, and whole lot of
      delicious yumminess packing an out-of-this-world nutritional punch. I’d
      never imagined it, let alone tasted it, until a couple of weeks ago when I
      was attending Monica Corrado’s Teacher Training at Sunrise Ranch, CO. Sous
      Chef Ace Linne-Speidel brought it out at dinner our first evening there,
      all while extolling the virtues of roasted marrow from grass-fed cows and
      appreciating the depth and quality of grass-fed butter. As the week
      progressed, he whipped his Bone Marrow Butter into mashed sweet potatoes
      at lunch, spread it over grass-fed steaks with breakfast, and brought it
      to the table for students to use with abandon on slices of homemade
      sourdough.
